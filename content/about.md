<div align="center">
<p>
Neil Stoddard is an amatuer photographer living outside Austin, Texas.
</p>
<p>
Shapes, colors, textures, and lines make life more interesting. Eyes tell stories which words cannot.
</p>
<p>
The world around us is always speaking.
</p>
<p>
Photography helps me slow down, see, hear and feel.
