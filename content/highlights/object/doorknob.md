This door is to a small outbuilding kitchen originally owned by my second-great-grandfather, Michael Barclay. Grandpa Barclay had a hard life after losing his wife and sustaining a work injury leaving him unable to care for his children. He was forced to send his children to board and work for others, and had to sell everything he owned. He finished his life living with his daughter Maggie and husband Brigham Gardner in Spanish Fork, Utah. His last remaining property was this small building which was moved from Provo to Spanish Fork and placed behind the house Grandpa Brigham had built for his precious Maggie. Michael Barclay passed the day after my maternal grandfather Mark Gardner was born in the same house. The building still sits behind the house in Spanish Fork and is now used as a storage shed. The doorknob is original to the building and is a reminder of the hard life of my ancestors.
