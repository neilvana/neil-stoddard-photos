The Archie Bray Foundation provides an environment that stimulates creative work in ceramics. The Bray is a place that is both a sanctuary and a community. The grounds are scattered with exquisite sculptures nestled among the decrepit remains of the old brick factory and the raw wilderness of the Montana landscape.
