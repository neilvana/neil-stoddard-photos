Outside of Eureka, Utah, the Tintic Standard Reduction Mill is a fascinating set of ruins. The mill sits abandoned and is a very dangerous place to explore, so be sure to stay back if you pass by. This picture was taken from a safe distance behind the fences warning of the dangers of the site. The mill was used to process silver ore from the mines in the area. The mill only operated for five years, but left the soil and water poisoned with led and arsenic.
